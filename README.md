## Introduction

Thank you for stopping by my developer/freelance profile.

I have a curated a selection of repositories to highlight my experience.

Currently (12/15/2024) it's a heavy work in progress as i finish building out my portfolio over this "week of content".

## Programming Repositories of interest

### Code snippets

Please browse my [code snippets repository](https://git.knownelement.com/reachableceo/ReachableCEO-ShellScriptPortfolio) to see a collection of small code bits I've written over the years.

### Shell scripting framework

I have written a collection of scripts to start new full sized/production coding projects.

It's a collection of methodologies, practices, approaches etc that I've picked up over time.

### Markdown/Typst Build Pipeline

I am not using my shell scripting framework for the small/medium examples. They started off as five line scripts and evolved. 
I will use my shell script framework for the large example as that's an inherently complex/massive project (a book).

- Core minimum viable product [rcdocs](https://git.knownelement.com/reachableceo/rcdoc-pipeline)

- Small example:
    -  Simple client/server/microservice model.
    -  Combines data from multiple markdown/csv files into a single markdown file.
    -  Includes table generation from CSV.
    - Fully production ready (v1.0 release cut 12/15/2024) and (other than jsonresume output) should be code/feature/test suite complete and considered in maintenance mode.
    -  [markdown resume](https://git.knownelement.com/reachableceo/MarkdownResume-Pipeline-ClientExample)
    
- Medium example.
    - Has everything from the small example.
    - Also uses the TSYS secrets manaer.
    - Used by the @ReachableCEO daily for producing his stakeholder reports in an automated fashion.
    - Pulls in data from various backends via API (hence use of secrets manager)
    - Currently (12/15/2024) a major work in progress and not production ready.
    
    -  [daily stakeholder report pipeline ](https://git.knownelement.com/reachableceo/DailyStakeholderReport-Pipeline)

- Large example:
    -  Ignore this for now. It's a massive work in progress and will be my main February project.

### Private Cloud Orchestration System

Currently (12/15/2024) this is being re-factored from monolith into microservice before release
